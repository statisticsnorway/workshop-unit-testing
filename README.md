## Overview
The main goal behind this workshop is to get familiar with JUnit and Mockito. We will see how to migrate projects from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. It also includes the new features supported in JUnit-5. We will write some sample exercises.


## Step 1: Clone the repository

```
https://github.com/statisticsnorway/workshop-unit-testing.git
```
Projects has two modules of tests. One with JUnit 4 tests and other with JUnit 5 tests. JUnit 4 tests will be referred just to give a demo on how to migrate from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.

## Step 2: Clean build the project
``` mvn clean install```

Now after project builds successfully, move to next step [Overview-JUnit](JUnit/overview.md)
