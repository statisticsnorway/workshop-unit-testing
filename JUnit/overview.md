# JUnit 5
[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language that plays a big role in regression testing. An open-source framework, it is used to write and run repeatable automated tests.
JDK 8 brought very exciting features in java and most notably [lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html). 

JUnit 5 aims to adapt java 8 style of coding and several other features as well, thatâ€™s why java 8 is required to create and execute tests in JUnit 5.

##Prerequisites
JUnit 5 requires Java 8 (or higher) at runtime. However, you can still test code that has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK.

## JUnit 5 Architecture
JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects:

``` 
JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage 
```
